Click create. Select Azure virtual machine. Select your subscription then go to resource group. If you don't have one, click create new. Name your Virtual machine, select your region. For image, I'm selecting windows 10 pro, ver 22H2. Size will be standard, 2 vcpus with 1 gib memory. Fill Administrator account section out with a username and password. Make it what you want, and don't forget to write it down! Checkmark Licensing box, then click review+create.
